# altlab-timeline

This plugin takes posts (custom post types or regular) and puts them into Knight Lab's [Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/).

It creates a custom post type called Timelines. It uses the featured images from the posts as the image and the post content is the body of the event.

You can restrict the events in the timeline by using categories.
